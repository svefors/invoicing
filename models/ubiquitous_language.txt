=== Accounting ===
- An Account can be closed.
- If an Account is closed then it is not possible to post transactions to it.
- If viewed in the Ledger, if an account is closed, and there are no transactions within 
the view period, the account is not shown.
- The Chart of Accounts show only the open accounts(or a redline through closed ones?)
- If a closed account does not have transactions posted to it, 
then it is possible to delete it.
- It is possible to repoen an account.
- It is not possible for two accounts, closed or open, to have the same account nr. 


Posting rules: Possible solutions
- If a posting rule uses a closed account, it can override and reopen the closed account?
- Put the commands on an error queue until the administrator has solved the problem. (+1)
- Write checks in the UI to check if there is a posting rule that uses the account. (+1)
